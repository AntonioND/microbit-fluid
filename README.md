# Microbit Fluid Simulation

## General

This is an extremely simple fluid simulation for the micro:bit. The input is
the accelerometer included in the board, and the output is the LED matrix.

I've used python and Mu editor to develop this demo. This editor can be found in
the following links:

The code of the regular demo is in `fluid.py`.

There's also a version for the "micro:pixel 4x8 NeoPixel board for BBC
micro:bit" (PPMB00100) in `fluid_rgb.py`.
